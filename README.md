# Astronomer-airflow-chaos

To test the resiliency of the Astronomer Airflow platform deployed on Kubernetes, you can employ a combination of chaos engineering techniques and best practices. Here's a comprehensive approach to ensure your Airflow deployment is robust and reliable:

## Chaos Engineering Techniques

### Resource Tests

**CPU Scalability Test**
- Inject CPU pressure into your Airflow pods using a chaos engineering tool.
- Gradually increase CPU consumption to 50%, 75%, and 90% capacity.
- Observe how Airflow components respond and if they scale as expected[4].

**Memory Scalability Test**
- Similar to the CPU test, apply memory pressure to Airflow pods.
- Increase memory consumption in stages: 50%, 75%, and 90%.
- Monitor Airflow's performance and resource allocation[4].

### Redundancy Tests

**Host Redundancy Test**
- Randomly shut down a host or container running Airflow components.
- Verify that Airflow continues to function without interruption[4].

**Zone Redundancy Test**
- Simulate an Availability Zone outage by making it unreachable.
- Ensure Airflow services failover to other zones seamlessly[2][4].

### Dependency and Network Tests

**Dependency Failure Test**
- Drop network traffic to specific dependencies (e.g., metadata database).
- Verify Airflow's ability to handle unavailable dependencies[4].

**Dependency Latency Test**
- Introduce network latency (e.g., 100ms delay) to Airflow dependencies.
- Observe how Airflow performs under slow network conditions[4].

## Airflow-Specific Resilience Testing

### Scheduler Resilience

- Run multiple scheduler instances and simulate a scheduler failure.
- Verify that tasks continue to be scheduled and executed without interruption[1].

### Webserver High Availability

- Deploy multiple webserver instances behind a load balancer.
- Take down one webserver and ensure the Airflow UI remains accessible[1].

### Metadata Database Resilience

- Test database replication and failover mechanisms.
- Simulate a primary database failure and verify automatic failover to a replica[1].

### DAG and Task Resilience

- Implement and test automatic retries for tasks with appropriate delays.
- Verify that failed tasks are retried according to the defined retry policy[1].

### Executor Scalability

- If using CeleryExecutor or KubernetesExecutor, test the ability to scale workers.
- Increase the workload and observe if additional workers are provisioned as needed[1].

## Best Practices for Testing

1. **Use a Staging Environment**: Perform these tests in a staging environment that mirrors production to avoid impacting live workflows[1].

2. **Implement Monitoring and Alerting**: Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting for Airflow components to detect issues during testing[1].

3. **Automate Tests**: Use tools like Gremlin or Chaos Mesh to automate resilience tests, integrating them into your CI/CD pipeline[3][4].

4. **Gradual Approach**: Start with less disruptive tests and gradually increase the complexity and impact of your resilience testing[4].

5. **Regular Testing**: Schedule these tests to run periodically (e.g., weekly or monthly) to ensure ongoing resilience[4].

6. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of test scenarios, results, and any improvements made based on findings.

By systematically applying these resilience testing techniques, you can ensure that your Astronomer Airflow platform on Kubernetes is robust, scalable, and capable of handling various failure scenarios. This approach will help maintain high availability and reliability of your data pipelines in production environments.
